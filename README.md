This is my final project for the Ruby on Rails curriculum found on The Odin Project.

In this project I made a Facebook clone with features such as signing in/signing up(using devise gem), friends, friend requests, posts, comments, likes, and create your own profile. I learned how to associate each model with each other and also how to use a Facebook Api to let users sign in with their facebook accounts. I also expiremented with bulma to style my project.

My project was deployed on heroku and can be found here:
